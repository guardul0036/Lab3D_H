# Lab3D_H

We were only able to get some of the functions to work

- total requests
- requests per month
- percentage of requests that were not successful
- percentage of requests that were directed elsewhere
- logs broken into seperate files by month 

We weren't able to figure out how to work with datetime so we turned each line in the file into a list of strings and worked with it from there
